# Week 1: Git and GitHub

## Key Concepts

**Repository (Repo):** A project folder tracked by git

**Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time

**Staging Area:** Where you prepare files before committing

**Remote:** The GitHub copy of your repository (backup + collaboration)

## The Three States
1. Working Directory - your actual files
2. Staging Area - files ready to be committed  
3. Repository - permanently saved versions

## Essential Commands
- `git status` - Check what's changed
- `git add .` - Stage all changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save changes
- `git push` - Upload to GitHub
- `git pull` - Download from GitHub
- `git log` - View history

## Workflow
1. Make changes to files
2. `git status` (check what changed)
3. `git add .` (stage changes)
4. `git commit -m "descriptive message"` (save)
5. `git push` (upload to GitHub)
